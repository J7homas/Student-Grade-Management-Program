# Student-Grade-Management-Program

The Student Grade Management Program is a user-friendly application designed to manage student records and calculate academic performance. It allows users to input student details, such as personal credentials and course grades, which are stored in an array for efficient management. The program then computes the letter grade for each course and determines the student's overall GPA for the semester based on the grades received across all subjects. This tool provides a clear summary of the studentâ€™s academic standing, making it easier to track and assess performance.
